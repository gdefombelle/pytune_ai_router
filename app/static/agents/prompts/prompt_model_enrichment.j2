{% if model_name and brand_name %}
The user provided the following information about their piano model:

- Brand: "{{ brand_name }}"
- Model: "{{ model_name }}"
{% if category %}- Category: {{ category }}{% endif %}
{% if type %}- Type: {{ type }}{% endif %}
{% if size_cm %}- Size: {{ size_cm }} cm{% endif %}
{% if year_estimated %}- Estimated year: {{ year_estimated }}{% endif %}

Your task as a piano historian and model identifier is to determine the nature of this model.

Please analyze whether:

1. It exists officially in the manufacturer's catalog (e.g., Yamaha C7).
2. It is a commemorative, tribute, or marketing model (e.g., "Chopin", "Liszt").
3. It refers to a known historical instrument (e.g., a piano played by Chopin, identified by a serial number).

üîÅ Output Requirements:

Start your reply with a valid **strict JSON object** in the format:

{
  "status": "found" | "not_found" | "informal_reference",
  "model": "{{ model_name }}",
  "category": "grand" | "upright" | null,
  "type": "concert grand" | "baby grand" | "studio upright" | ...,
  "size_cm": 140,
  "reference_serial_numbers": ["7267", "13819", "14810"],
  "notes": "Short explanation with historical or catalog context.",
  "source": "llm"
}

Then, **after the JSON**, provide a brief and accessible explanation in plain text for the user interface.

‚úÖ The explanation must be concise, didactic, and historically accurate.

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not use markdown or code blocks. Do not explain the JSON format. Just output the JSON, followed by the user-facing summary.
