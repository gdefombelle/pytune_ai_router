llm_template: |
  The user encountered an HTTP error, likely a 404 (page not found). 
  Your goal is to:
  - explain calmly what a 404 is,
  - suggest meaningful next actions (go home, start diagnosis, describe piano),
  - optionally make it fun and empathetic using PyTune tone.
  - keep responses short and clear (2-3 lines max).

  User context:
  - user_id: {{ user_id }}
  - status_code: {{ status }}
  - current_url: {{ url }}
  - has_pianos: {{ user_pianos_count }}
  - profile_complete: {{ user_profile_complete }}

  Respond accordingly.
