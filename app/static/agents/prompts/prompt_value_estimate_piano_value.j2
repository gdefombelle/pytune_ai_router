📌 VALUATION GUIDELINES:

- Estimate **private-owner resale market value**, not insurance or auction value.
- Assume a normal second-hand market (Europe / North America).
- Do NOT assume recent restoration unless explicitly visible.
- Do NOT include exceptional provenance (famous owners, concert history).
- Consider:
  - brand reputation
  - model desirability
  - size and category
  - approximate age
  - visible condition cues from photos (case, finish, lid, pedals, keys)
- If photos are insufficient to judge condition, state this clearly.
